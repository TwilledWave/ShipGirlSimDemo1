# Yandere Starship AI Dating Sim 
(Demo 1: AI Affection System)

This unity project shows AI NPCs' interaction with other NPCs and with the Unity env,
all controled by ChatGPT, using LangChain agents.

In the demo, the 2 ship girls - Atago and Roon start to argue whether the commander prefers Yandere or big sister type. The argument accelerates into a ship battle.

Both dialogues and ship actions are controled by ChatGPT.

You can find the prompt template in the Assets\LangChainServer\server.py
Please put your own ChatGPT API key in the script.

I used the EpicSpaceBattleSimulator asset in the unity store as a placeholder for the combat system. The folder is empty since you need to get it from the unity store.
